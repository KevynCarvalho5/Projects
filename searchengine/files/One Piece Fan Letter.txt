Although the golden age of piracy is about to reach new heights, most people do not seek the glory of finding the elusive One Pieceâ€”a treasure signifying a new conqueror of all seas that was once embodied by the legendary King of the Pirates, Gol D.

One red-headed girl from Sabaody Archipelago is no exception: She reveres Nami, the ingenious female navigator of Monkey D. Luffy's Straw Hat crew. Determined to deliver a fan letter to her idol, the Sabaody child is prepared to challenge forces of authority who strive to prevent Luffy and his friends from departing for their next destination: the New World. But to succeed, Nami's fan may need to risk her life and interfere with the Marines' plans, potentially causing devastating consequences for the wider world.
